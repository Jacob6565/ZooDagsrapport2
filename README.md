# Aalborg Zoo Project

The following project was done as part of the third semester of the 2017 fall Software education at Aalborg University.

When receiving the project, Application.StartupUri will be on line 8 in App.xaml.

To open the zookeeper view, in the App.xaml file, replace the Application.StartupUri with:
StartupUri="View/ZooKeeper/MainWindow.xaml" (this will already be the StartupUri when you receive the project)

To open the office view, in the App.xaml file, replace the Application.StartupUri with:
StartupUri="View/OfficeView.xaml" (this will be placed on line 11 when you receive the project)
